Things that i remember:

Manage the permission setting for the respective page on the PageBuilder
Create the session security class ( Created but not implemented)
set routes redirect based on the configs
Manage access to css  & javacript in the pages
Translations component
404 not found page + Unauthorizared etc ( this middleware is extremely important)
